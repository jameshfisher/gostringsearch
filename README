This is a collection of string search algorithms,
mostly based on the Wikipedia documentation (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_searching_algorithm),
for all to use.

They are supposed to be didactic
(Via copious commenting and readable var names, etc -- I'm teaching myself, too)
as well as production-ready.
